Things left to do:
==================

    * Blacklist -- optionally blacklist when you report to spamcop

    * Custom Filter -- action for pending emails (Requested by Lloyd Zusman)

    * FAQ -- should this be made a CGI?  Add help on adding whitelist &
             blacklist options.

    * Filter Viewer -- graphic view of your filters

    * List Editor -- current editor is fine for short lists, but lacking for
                     long lists

    * Remember Keyword Addreses -- Put all 'keyword' addresses you generate in
                                   a list for easy revocation later

    * Remember Me -- set a cookie to skip login

    * Revoke Keyword Addresses -- Once they're remembered, have a way to add
                                  these addresses to a revocation list

    * Search -- Implement Cacheing for Pending List, and implement Search for 
                lists and/or filters

    * Sort -- Allow the Pending List to be sorted by other methods than Date:
              Size, subject, etc.

    * Un-ugly Errors -- Samuel Hill writes:
        Those python errors just freak normal people out when there is not
        really a serious problem.  Maybe tmda-cgi, instead of dumping
        information to the user, could dump it to a log file instead.  Then,
        tmda-cgi just goes back to pending or displays a friendly message like
        "error occurred, please log in again".
