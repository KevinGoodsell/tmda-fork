Things left to do:
==================

    * Change Password -- figure out a way to do it or remove it from the menu

    * Equivilant Parts -- it would be nice to only show one part if two parts
                          of an e-mail are equivilant (i.e. text & HTML)

    * FAQ -- should this be made a CGI?  Add help on adding whitelist &
             blacklist options.

    * Filter Viewer -- graphic view of your filters

    * Hide Nasty -- need a way to hide the nasty HTML in viewed e-mails

    * Language Support -- code to recognize the language an e-mail is in and
                          include the appropriate language identifiers in the
                          viewer

    * Remove JS -- Javascript code should not be in PendList.py.  It should be
                   in the template pending.ht.

    * SpamCop -- an option to delete/blacklist/forward to SpamCop

    * Tutorial -- someone should write one

    * URL Confirmation -- doesn't work yet for virtual users
