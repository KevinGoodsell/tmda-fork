Things left to do:
==================

    * Blacklist -- optionally blacklist when you report to spamcop

    * Custom Filter -- action for pending emails (Requested by Lloyd Zusman)

    * FAQ -- should this be made a CGI?  Add help on adding whitelist &
             blacklist options.

    * Filter Viewer -- graphic view of your filters

    * List Editor -- current editor is fine for short lists, but lacking for
                     long lists

    * Remember Me -- set a cookie to skip login

    * Search -- for pending list and/or lists and filters
