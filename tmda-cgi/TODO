Things left to do:
==================

    * SpamCop -- an option to delete/blacklist/forward to SpamCop

    * Language Support -- code to recognize the language an e-mail is in and
                          include the appropriate language identifiers in the
                          viewer

    * Install / Uninstall -- options to allow users to add or remove TMDA
                             filtering from their e-mail account

    * Auto-Cleanup -- scheduling and somehow dealing with virtual users

    * Filter Viewer -- graphic view of your filters

    * List Editor -- view and edit your lists

    * Change Password -- figure out a way to do it or remove it from the menu

    * Equivilant Parts -- it would be nice to only show one part if two parts
                          of an e-mail are equivilant (i.e. text & HTML)

    * Hide Nasty -- need a way to hide the nasty HTML in viewed e-mails
