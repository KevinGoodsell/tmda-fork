If you are upgrading from a release of tmda-cgi < 0.02:

* Requires TMDA release 0.74 or later

* New authentication mechanisms (which appear to work).  To
  facilitate this there are new parameters in the ./compile script.
  These are:
    -f <authfile>
    --file-auth <authfile>
      Specify a different authentication file than the default.
      - The default is either <config_directory>/tmda-cgi, ~/.tmda/tmda-cgi
        for the authenticating user, or /etc/tmda-cgi, whichever is found
        first.

    -p <checkpassword>
    --program-auth <checkpassword>
      Specify checkpassword-style authentication
       - Must conform exactly to the checkpassword stardard
            http://cr.yp.to/checkpwd/interface.html
        - Any program that returns '0' (true) is acceptable as the command
          run by the checkpassword program upon successful authentication.
        - If "program" requires commandline switches, you must supply the
          command to be run upon successful authentication.
          If "program" does not, the default program (/usr)/bin/true is
          automatically appended if not specified.
        Examples: -p "/usr/sbin/checkpassword-pam -s id -- /bin/true"
                  -p /usr/local/vpopmair/vchkpw
                     (/usr/bin/true or /bin/true is automatically used)

    -r protocol[://host[:port]][/dn]
    --remote-auth protocol[://host[:port]][/dn]
        Host to connect to to check username and password.
        - Allowed protocols are:
            imap, imaps, apop, pop3, ldap
        - Host defaults to localhost
        - Port defaults to default port for the protocol
        - dn is manditory for ldap and must contain a '%(user)s'
          identifying the username
        Examples: -r imap
                  -r imaps://myimapserver.net
                  -r pop3://mypopserver.net:2110
                  -r ldap://host.com/cn=%(user)s,dc=host,dc=com

* Please note that program authentication and remote authentication are
  subject to change as the code implementing these methods is alpha
  stable and not thoroughly tested.
  
* Please remember to delete ./compile.ini if it exists before you
  recompile

* Added virtual user support.  If you have virtual users on your system,
  you will want to configure -l and -v options when you compile.

======================================================================

If you are upgrading from a release of tmda-cgi < 0.01:

* tmda-cgi has been split off from TMDA.  compile now runs in a handy
  interactive mode if you supply no options.  You will need to re-
  compile and specify the path to your TMDA install.

* CGI_USER has been abandoned.  This is now compiled in.
