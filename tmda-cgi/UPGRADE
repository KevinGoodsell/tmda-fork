======================================================================

If you are upgrading from a release of tmda-cgi < 0.01:

* tmda-cgi has been split off from TMDA.  compile now runs in a handy
  interactive mode if you supply no options.  You will need to re-
  compile and specify the path to your TMDA install.

* CGI_USER has been abandoned.  This is now compiled in.
