If you are upgrading from a release of tmda-cgi < 0.07:

* display directory has been updated again.  You'll need to copy in the new
  one or use a symbolic link.

* If you are upgrading from 0.03 or higher, you shouldn't need to recompile.

======================================================================

If you are upgrading from a release of tmda-cgi < 0.03:

* Requires TMDA release 0.75 or later

* Changed the parameter string you must enter into compile to make tmda-cgi
  work with virtual users.  The new default for this is:

  vpopmail1 /home/vpopmail/bin/vuserinfo ~

  DO NOT USE THE OLD STRING AS IT WILL NOT WORK!

* display directory has *NO* similarity to the earlier setup.  If you do not
  currently use a symbolic link to put the display directory in your web
  tree, then you will want to completely delete your current display
  directory and replace it with the new one.  We highly recommend using a
  symbolic link if this option is available to you.  The display directory
  is expected to change a lot in the next few releases.

======================================================================

If you are upgrading from a release of tmda-cgi < 0.02:

* Requires TMDA release 0.74 or later

* New authentication mechanisms (which appear to work).  To
  facilitate this there are new parameters in the ./compile script.
  These are:
    -f <authfile>
    --file-auth <authfile>
      Specify a different authentication file than the default.
      - The default is either <config_directory>/tmda-cgi, ~/.tmda/tmda-cgi
        for the authenticating user, or /etc/tmda-cgi, whichever is found
        first.

    -p <checkpassword>
    --program-auth <checkpassword>
      Specify checkpassword-style authentication
       - Must conform exactly to the checkpassword stardard
            http://cr.yp.to/checkpwd/interface.html
        - Any program that returns '0' (true) is acceptable as the command
          run by the checkpassword program upon successful authentication.
        - If "program" requires commandline switches, you must supply the
          command to be run upon successful authentication.
          If "program" does not, the default program (/usr)/bin/true is
          automatically appended if not specified.
        Examples: -p "/usr/sbin/checkpassword-pam -s id -- /bin/true"
                  -p /usr/local/vpopmair/vchkpw
                     (/usr/bin/true or /bin/true is automatically used)

    -r protocol[://host[:port]][/dn]
    --remote-auth protocol[://host[:port]][/dn]
        Host to connect to to check username and password.
        - Allowed protocols are:
            imap, imaps, apop, pop3, ldap
        - Host defaults to localhost
        - Port defaults to default port for the protocol
        - dn is manditory for ldap and must contain a '%(user)s'
          identifying the username
        Examples: -r imap
                  -r imaps://myimapserver.net
                  -r pop3://mypopserver.net:2110
                  -r ldap://host.com/cn=%(user)s,dc=host,dc=com

* Please note that program authentication and remote authentication are
  subject to change as the code implementing these methods is alpha
  stable and not thoroughly tested.
  
* Please remember to delete ./compile.ini if it exists before you
  recompile

* Added virtual user support.  If you have virtual users on your system,
  you will want to configure -l and -v options when you compile.

======================================================================

If you are upgrading from a release of tmda-cgi < 0.01:

* tmda-cgi has been split off from TMDA.  compile now runs in a handy
  interactive mode if you supply no options.  You will need to re-
  compile and specify the path to your TMDA install.

* CGI_USER has been abandoned.  This is now compiled in.
