	* Added vpopmail1 stub.

	  I'm calling it vpopmail1 instead of just vpopmail because it is
	  possible that future versions (or perhaps even older versions) of
	  vpopmail may require a radically different stub program.  We may
	  have to add more stubs to support these versions instead of just
	  making the current stub smarter.
