                    TMDA!</h2>
                  <p><a href="http://tmda.sourceforge.net">TMDA</a> (tagged message delivery agent) is the
                    free answer to your spam woes. Unlike other filters that look
                    for keywords such as &quot;viagra&quot;, &quot;sweepstakes&quot;,
                    and &quot;lesbians&quot;; TMDA uses a simple, but highly reliable
                    method for determining which e-mails come from real people...
                    it asks them!</p>
                  <p><b><img src="%(ThemeDir)s/diagram.png" width="361" height="237" align="right">TMDA
                    asks people if they are real?</b></p>
                  <p>Yes, it is called a &quot;challenge/response method&quot;.
                    When someone sends mail to a TMDA guarded e-mail address for
                    the first time, instead of just blindly dumping the message
                    in your in-box, TMDA puts it in a special quarantine area
                    and sends a &quot;<a href="%(Script)s?cmd=conf-example&SID=%(SID)s">challenge</a>&quot; back to
                    the author. The challenge is just an e-mail that briefly explains
                    the system and asks the user to reply to the challenge (this
                    is the &quot;response&quot; part). Once TMDA receives the
                    response, it releases the original message from quarantine
                    and adds the sender to a list of people from which it will
                    accept mail. Any future messages from that user will be accepted
                    without another challenge.</p>
                  <p><b>How does that help?</b></p>
                  <p>Spammers typically put fake e-mail addresses on their spam.
                    They don't want you to reply to them. The address they use
                    is bad, so they never receive TMDA's challenge, they never
                    get to respond, the message is never released from quarantine,
                    and it never makes it to your in-box. Instead, it sits around
                    and gathers dust until the system throws it away.</p>
                  <p><b>Great! How do I get it!</b></p>
                  <p>&quot;Getting it&quot; is easy, simply click the link at
                    the end of this page to install the system. But before you
                    do, please take a few minutes and look over the following
                    FAQs (frequently asked questions). TMDA is a radically different
                    way to handle your mail, so it is best to understand some
                    of the finer details before you proceed.</p>
