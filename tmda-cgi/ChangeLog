	  to blow up.

2003-08-11  Gre7g Luterman  <gre7g@wolfhome.com>

	  problems.

	* What hasn't changed?  Tons of bug fixes.  New display templates.
	  You won't even recognize tmda-cgi now!

	* We no longer support ?debug=1 mode.  If you are having problems
	  logging in, do a "View/Source" on the login page and look for a
	  rather large block of comments at the top of the page.  If the
	  program found any hints as to why the login failed, they will be
	  detailed there.  You can edit the login.html template if you don't
	  wish for this information to be available.

	* SECURITY ADVISORY *
	  A rather large security hole was plugged.  Users running in system-
	  wide mode were vulnerable to real users running privileged commands
	  in their config files.  Users with releases prior to 0.03 are
	  STRONGLY ENCOURAGED to upgrade to the latest version.

	  option.
