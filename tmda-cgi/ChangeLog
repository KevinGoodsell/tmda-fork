	* Display international characters in both pending lists and e-mails.

2003-05-04  Gre7g Luterman  <gre7g@wolfhome.com>

	* Replaced compile with new, improved configure.  Makes better guesses
	  about where TMDA is installed.  A little more standard to use.

2003-05-03  Gre7g Luterman  <gre7g@wolfhome.com>

	  "delete", "blacklist", and "whitelist".

	* Added a button on the ending list that marks all messages "read".

	  option.

	  editing the config file.

	  templates to display who the e-mail was to.

	  "pending" or "gen_addr".

	* Don't use environment variable TMDA_VUSER if no virtual users are on
	  the system.

2003-04-28  Gre7g Luterman  <gre7g@wolfhome.com>

	* tmda-cgi 0.07 is released.

2003-04-27  Gre7g Luterman  <gre7g@wolfhome.com>

	* Added install/uninstall/restore code.  It's quite huge so I won't be
	  the least bit surprised if it is buggy (despite the million install/
	  uninstall cycles I've run!).

	* Minor tweaks to the info pages.  More stuff shown to help diagnose
	  problems.

2003-04-24  Gre7g Luterman  <gre7g@wolfhome.com>

	* Correct line feeds in filter file before saving.

	  installs.

2003-04-23  Gre7g Luterman  <gre7g@wolfhome.com>

	  and "info" buttons.

	* Added a bugfix that was causing some users to get an error when
	  the pending list tried to find the size of a message.  No idea why
	  it was doing that!

2003-04-19  Gre7g Luterman  <gre7g@wolfhome.com>

	* Added code for "theme picker", "logout", and "global config" buttons.

2003-04-19  Gre7g Luterman  <gre7g@wolfhome.com>

	* tmda-cgi 0.03 is released.

	* What hasn't changed?  Tons of bug fixes.  New display templates.
	  You won't even recognize tmda-cgi now!

	* We no longer support ?debug=1 mode.  If you are having problems
	  logging in, do a "View/Source" on the login page and look for a
	  rather large block of comments at the top of the page.  If the
	  program found any hints as to why the login failed, they will be
	  detailed there.  You can edit the login.html template if you don't
	  wish for this information to be available.

	* SECURITY ADVISORY *
	  A rather large security hole was plugged.  Users running in system-
	  wide mode were vulnerable to real users running privileged commands
	  in their config files.  Users with releases prior to 0.03 are
	  STRONGLY ENCOURAGED to upgrade to the latest version.

	* Incorporated some compiler requests from Time Rice like the -D
	  option.
