This file contains a list of new features and capabilities by TMDA
version.  These blurbs are what are usually included in release
announcements under "What's new?".  Make sure to read the UPGRADE
file in this directory as well.

======================================================================

TMDA 1.1.6 "Glen Albyn" --

* tmda-ofmipd now has "one-session" mode through the '--one-session'
  command-line option, courtesy of Stephen Warren.  This allows you to
  use xinetd or tcpserver, possibly in conjunction with stunnel, to
  spawn tmda-ofmipd, rather than having tmda-ofmipd bind to a port and
  accept connections on its own.

  This allows you to re-use your existing xinetd/tcpserver
  configuration/management and access control rules.  It also allows
  tmda-ofmipd to see the real IP address of the client, for better
  Received: line logging.

  See the contrib/ofmipd-stunnel-xinetd directory for a README and
  some configuration examples.

======================================================================

TMDA 1.1.4 "Edradour" --

* The new 'dot-tmda' directory in contrib contains a working ~/.tmda/
  structure that can be used with only a few changes.  See the README
  in that directory for more info.  Not documented yet outside of the
  README, but this might help new TMDA users get started quicker.

* Some of the tmda-* programs will now run on native win32
  (tmda-address, tmda-check-address, tmda-pending, and tmda-keygen).

* tmda-ofmipd has a new option (--pure-proxy) that can proxy mail for
  non-TMDA users in addition to TMDA users.  This might be useful if
  you run a mixed environment, and want to use tmda-ofmipd for
  everyone.  See `tmda-ofmipd --help' for more on this option.

======================================================================

TMDA 1.1.3 "Dailuaine" --

* New feature from David Bremner.  Add 'shell=' and 'python=' tag
  actions to the outgoing filter.  This allows you to add
  dynamic/shell escaped headers from the outgoing filter file.  For
  example usage, see the TMDA/Hashcash HOWTO I've prepared at
  http://wiki.tmda.net/TmdaHashCashHowto

* The template system has been reorganized to simplify things for
  users of multi-lingual templates among others.  See
  http://wiki.tmda.net/TemplateHowto and the UPGRADE notes below.

* Messages are now simply deleted from your pending queue once they
  are confirmed or released rather than being renamed with a '3,C' or
  '3,R' suffix.  This provides simpler, more intuitive behavior and
  decreased storage requirements.

======================================================================

TMDA 1.1.2 "Caol Ila" --

* Fixed a bug in TMDAINJECT that caused Message-ID and Date headers to
  differ when sending to multiple recipients.

* Fixes to the tmda.spec file that should allow RPMs to be built with
  Python 2.3.x.

======================================================================

TMDA 1.1.1 "Balblair" --

* Tilde expansion is now done automatically for variables in
  /etc/tmdarc and ~/.tmda/config, so you no longer have to use
  os.path.expanduser() to do this yourself.  e.g,

  TEMPLATE_DIR = "~/.tmda/templates"

  now ``just works''.

* New 'whitelist' behavior for tmda-pending and tmda-cgi, controlled
  by http://wiki.tmda.net/ConfigurationVariables#PENDING_WHITELIST_RELEASE

* A new 'pipe-headers' incoming filter file source.  Identical to
  'pipe' except that it only pipes the headers to the program, instead
  of the headers + body.  This should offer greater performance and
  reliability when processing the message body isn't required.

* A new feature to add Mail-Followup-To headers from tmda-sendmail or
  tmda-ofmipd to messages.  See
  http://wiki.tmda.net/ConfigurationVariables#MAIL_FOLLOWUP_TO
