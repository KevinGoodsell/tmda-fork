TMDA FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Q. What makes TMDA qmail-specific?  I'd like to try it, but my mail
   server is running another MTA.

   TMDA currently utilizes qmail's "special features" extensively and
   so it would take additional work to replicate much of TMDA's
   functionality for another MTA such as Sendmail or Postfix.
   However, the author is interested in supporting alternative MTAs,
   so if you have any thoughts on this, please contact us.

   Some of the qmail-specific elements of TMDA include:

   * tmda-inject uses per-user masquerading to tag outgoing mail with
     the proper address.  See "ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES" under
     <http://www.qmail.org/man/man8/qmail-inject.html>

   * tmda-filter uses qmail-specific exit codes to control whether the
     message is accepted, deferred, bounced, etc.  See "EXIT CODES"
     under <http://www.qmail.org/man/man8/qmail-command.html>

   * qmail-local supplies several useful environment variables to
     tmda-filter so that it knows whether the message was sent to a
     'dated' address, a 'sender' address, etc.  See "ENVIRONMENT
     VARIABLES" under <http://www.qmail.org/man/man8/qmail-command.html>

Q. Will TMDA run on non-unix clients such as Microsoft Windows?

A. Not directly since qmail is only available on UNIX.  However, you
   can configure your qmail relay to re-write the address of outgoing
   messages with tmda-inject, so that those running Microsoft Windows
   clients can take full advantage of TMDA.  See `README.RELAY' in the
   contrib/ directory for the full details.

   Also, for one user's configuration details for a site-wide TMDA
   install using smtpd-auth, vpopmail and qmailadmin, see:
   <http://mla.libertine.org/tmda-users/200108/msg00002.html>

Q. Can you clarify the syntax for the whitelist?  I'd like any
   address in my domain (domain.dom) to be able to send me mail
   directly without worrying about confirmations.

A. In addition to explicit e-mail addresses, TMDA supports matching
   patterns in the list files which use Unix shell-style wildcard
   characters.  The special characters are:

   Characters(s)    Description
   -------------    -----------
   *                Matches everything.
   ?                Matches any single character.
   [seq]            Matches any character in seq.
   [!seq]           Matches any character not in seq.

   In addition, `@=' (a custom rule) will expand to match both @ and
   @*. in one shot.

   Here are some common examples:
   
   # match only jdoe@domain.dom
   jdoe@domain.dom
   # match anyone@domain.dom, but not anyone@sub.domain.dom
   *@domain.dom 
   # match anyone@sub.domain.dom, but not anyone@domain.dom
   *@*.domain.dom
   # match both anyone@domain.dom, and anyone@sub.domain.dom
   *@=domain.dom   

   NOTE: For incoming mail, tmda-filter compares the address in the
   Envelope-Sender, the "From:" header and the "Reply-To:" header when
   looking for a match.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Q. How should I delete old, unconfirmed messages from TMDA's pending queue?

A. TMDA comes with a utility called `tmda-clean' which does this for
   you.  You can run it by hand, or periodically from cron.  Run
   `tmda-clean' without any arguments to get a listing of possible
   options.

   For example, to purge unconfirmed messages older than 14 days each
   morning at 2AM, add the following crontab entry:

   0 02 * * * /path/to/tmda/bin/tmda-clean 14d
