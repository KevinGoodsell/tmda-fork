Q. What makes TMDA qmail-specific?  I'd like to use it, but my site is
   running another MTA.

A. TMDA utilizes qmail's "special features" extensively and so it
   would take much more work to replicate TMDA's functionality on
   another MTA such as Sendmail.  For example:

   tmda-inject uses per-user masquerading to tag outgoing mail with
   the proper address.  See "ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES" under
   <http://www.qmail.org/man/man8/qmail-inject.html>

   tmda-filter uses qmail-specific exit codes to control whether the
   message is accepted, deferred, bounced, etc.  See "EXIT CODES"
   under <http://www.qmail.org/man/man8/qmail-command.html>

   qmail-local supplies several useful environment variables to
   tmda-filter so that it knows whether the message was sent to a
   'dated' address, a 'sender' address, or neither.  See "ENVIRONMENT
   VARIABLES" under <http://www.qmail.org/man/man8/qmail-command.html>

Q. Will TMDA run on non-unix clients such as Microsoft Windows?

A. Not directly since qmail is only available on UNIX.  However, you
   can configure your qmail relay to re-write the address of outgoing
   messages with tmda-inject, so that those running Microsoft Windows
   clients can take full advantage of TMDA.  See `README.RELAY' in the
   contrib/ directory for the full details.

Q. Can you clarify the syntax for .tmda-whitelist?  I'd like any
   address in my domain (domain.dom) to be able to send me mail
   directly without worrying about bounces.

A. In addition to explicit e-mail addresses, TMDA supports matching
   patterns in the .tmda-* files which use Unix shell-style wildcard
   characters.  The special characters are:

   Characters(s)    Description
   -------------    -----------
   *                Matches everything.
   ?                Matches any single character.
   [seq]            Matches any character in seq.
   [!seq]           Matches any character not in seq.

   In addition, a custom wildcard character `=' is available for
   matching both @ and @*. in one rule.

   Here are some common examples:
   
   # match only jdoe@domain.dom
   jdoe@domain.dom
   # match anyone@domain.dom, but not anyone@sub.domain.dom
   *@domain.dom 
   # match anyone@sub.domain.dom, but not anyone@domain.dom
   *@*.domain.dom
   # match both anyone@domain.dom, and anyone@sub.domain.dom
   *@=domain.dom   

   NOTE: For incoming mail, tmda-filter compares the address in the
   Envelope-Sender, the "From:" header and the "Reply-To:" header when
   looking for a match.
