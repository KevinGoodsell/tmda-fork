General

	- Find a TMDA logo (any graphic designers out there?)

	- Write a sendmail wrapper similar to qmail's sendmail wrapper
	that accepts sendmail options and then runs tmda-inject.
	Useful for MUAs such as VM which hardcode sendmail options
	when injecting mail.

	- Write a program to extract the From: address from a piped
	mail message and add it to the whitelist.  Once can then add a
	sender to their whitelist by piping a message directly from
	their MUA.
	
	- Write a LOGFILE statistics/summary script.
	
	- More OOP.

	- Elegant rewrites of some of the gorpish functions and
	flow-control in tmda-filter/tmda-inject.  (Are there any
	*good* _Python_ programmers out there?)
	
	- Regression testing script.
	
	- Move documentation into texinfo format.
	
	- Write a Tkinter based GUI for .tmdarc management.

	- Write a Python web-interface to the .tmda-* files to
	facilitate use by non-unix-shell users.

tmda-inject
	
	None
		
tmda-filter

	- (verify_dated_cookie): Incorrect MACs should be treated
	differently than expired dates since a wrong MAC is almost
	certainly a sign that someone is attempting forgery.
	
	- Support reading from DBM/GDBM style databases in addition to
	textfiles.
