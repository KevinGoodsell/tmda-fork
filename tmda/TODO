General
	- Investigate whether to distribute TMDA using the Python
	Distribution Utilities (``Distutils'') system.
	- Write a LOGFILE statistics/summary script.
	- Possibly Object-Orientize TMDA with Classes, inheritance,
	etc.  Are there any real benefits to doing this?
	- Regression testing script.
	- Move documentation into texinfo format.
	- Write a Tkinter based GUI for .tmdarc management.

tmda-inject
	- Possibly support regular expression matching for the special
	case addresses in addition to just matching specific
	addresses.
	- X-TMDA: bare timeout (to override Defaults.TIMEOUT)
		
tmda-filter
	- Support reading from DBM/GDBM style databases in addition to
	textfiles.

Whitelist.py
	- Support reading from DBM/GDBM style databases in addition to
	textfiles.  Currently, a 10,000 line whitelist is read in
	under 15 seconds on a PIII/700, but DB support may be
	necessary for much larger lists.
