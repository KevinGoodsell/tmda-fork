General
	
	- Investigate whether to distribute TMDA using the Python
	Distribution Utilities (``Distutils'') system.
	
	- Write a LOGFILE statistics/summary script.
	
	- Possibly Object-Orientize TMDA with Classes, inheritance,
	etc.  Are there any real benefits to doing this?
	
	- Regression testing script.
	
	- Move documentation into texinfo format.
	
	- Write a Tkinter based GUI for .tmdarc management.

	- Write a Python web-interface to the .tmda-* files to
	facilitate use by non-unix-shell users.

	- (verify_dated_cookie): Incorrect MACs should be treated
	differently than expired dates since a wrong MAC is almost
	certainly a sign that someone is attempting forgery.
	
	- Support reading from DBM/GDBM style databases in addition to
	textfiles.  Currently, a 10,000 line list is read in
	under 15 seconds on a PIII/700, but DB support may be
	necessary for much larger lists.
