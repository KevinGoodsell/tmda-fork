General

	- Find a TMDA logo (any graphic designers out there?)

	- Write a sendmail wrapper similar to qmail's sendmail wrapper
	that accepts sendmail options and then runs tmda-inject.
	Useful for MUAs such as VM which hardcode sendmail options
	when injecting mail.

	- Write a program to extract the From: address from a piped
	mail message and add it to the whitelist.  Once can then add a
	sender to their whitelist by piping a message directly from
	their MUA.
	
	- Write a LOGFILE statistics/summary script.
	
	- Possibly Object-Orientize TMDA with Classes, inheritance,
	etc.  Are there any real benefits to doing this?
	
	- Regression testing script.
	
	- Move documentation into texinfo format.
	
	- Write a Tkinter based GUI for .tmdarc management.

	- Write a Python web-interface to the .tmda-* files to
	facilitate use by non-unix-shell users.

tmda-inject

tmda-filter

	- (verify_dated_cookie): Incorrect MACs should be treated
	differently than expired dates since a wrong MAC is almost
	certainly a sign that someone is attempting forgery.
	
	- Support reading from DBM/GDBM style databases in addition to
	textfiles.  Currently, a 10,000 line list is read in
	under 15 seconds on a PIII/700, but DB support may be
	necessary for much larger lists.
