General
	
	- Investigate whether to distribute TMDA using the Python
	Distribution Utilities (``Distutils'') system.
	
	- Write a LOGFILE statistics/summary script.
	
	- Possibly Object-Orientize TMDA with Classes, inheritance,
	etc.  Are there any real benefits to doing this?
	
	- Regression testing script.
	
	- Move documentation into texinfo format.
	
	- Write a Tkinter based GUI for .tmdarc management.

tmda-inject
	
	- Possibly support regular expression matching for the special
	case addresses in addition to just matching specific
	addresses.
	
	- X-TMDA: bare timeout (to override Defaults.TIMEOUT)
		
tmda-filter

	- Move the bounce text out into seperate files (templates) so
	that it is easier for users to customize.  See mailman/templates
	and Mailman/MailList.py for example implementation.
	
	- Make bounces easier for the user to reply to, by perhaps
	adding a "Reply-To:" containing the new tagged
	address to the bounce. (suggested by Reuben Sumner)
	
	- Support reading from DBM/GDBM style databases in addition to
	textfiles.

Greylist.py
	
	- Support reading from DBM/GDBM style databases in addition to
	textfiles.  Currently, a 10,000 line list is read in
	under 15 seconds on a PIII/700, but DB support may be
	necessary for much larger lists.
