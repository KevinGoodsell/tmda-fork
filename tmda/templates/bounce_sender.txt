This notice was generated by TMDA v%(TMDA_VERSION)s %(TMDA_HOMEPAGE)s,
an automated SPAM/UCE reduction system.

Your e-mail message with the subject of "%(subject)s"
was not accepted because:
    
    1) Your address is not on the recipient's "whitelist", OR 
    2) The `sender' address you sent to was invalid.
        
Until the recipient adds you to their "whitelist", you can contact
them by sending e-mail to the following special address:
    
    <mailto:%(sender_cookie_address)s>
        
which will only work when you are sending e-mail from:
