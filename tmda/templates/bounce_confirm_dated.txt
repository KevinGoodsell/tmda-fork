Subject: Confirmation required for your message to %(envelope_recipient)s

This notice was generated by TMDA v%(TMDA_VERSION)s %(TMDA_HOMEPAGE)s,
an automated SPAM/UCE reduction system.

Your e-mail message with the subject of "%(subject)s"
is being held pending confirmation because:
    
    1) Your address is not on the recipient's "whitelist", OR 
    2) The `dated' address you sent to was invalid or expired.

To release your message for delivery, please send an empty reply to
this address:

    <mailto:%(confirm_accept_address)s>

Your mailer should have a "Reply" feature that uses this address
automatically.  If this does not work, simply copy the address and
paste it into the "To:" field of a new message.

This confirmation verifies that your message is legitimate and not
junk-mail.  Shortly after it is verified, you will be notified by
e-mail that your original message was delivered.

Until the recipient adds you to their "whitelist", you can contact
them by sending e-mail to the following special address:
    
    <mailto:%(dated_cookie_address)s>
        
which will expire in exactly %(timeout)s (%(utc_expire_date)s UTC).
