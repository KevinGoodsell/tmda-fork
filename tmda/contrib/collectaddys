"""
Collect e-mail addresses from mailboxes of various formats.
Unix-style mbox files, qmail-style Maildirs, and MH/nmh-style folders
are supported.  Each unique address is printed to stdout in lowercase.

Every file or directory within the current working directory is
assumed to be in one of the supported mailbox formats.

Sample usage:

$ cd ~/Mail/archive/
$ collectaddys > ~/.tmda/lists/whitelist
