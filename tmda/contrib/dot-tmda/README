Sample ~/.tmda/ files.  There is no one-size-fits-all set of files,
but these examples show common usage, and might help get you started.

You can use them as is without only a few modifications.  Copy them
with `cp -pR dot-tmda ~/.tmda'

Please make sure to read the documentation at http://tmda.net/unstable

====================================================================

config    You need to edit the required settings section for your
          environment.

crypt_key You must generate a unique key for yourself with:
	  tmda-keygen -b >> crypt_key

filters/  Example incoming and outgoing filter files.  They
          will work as is without modification, though you should
	  look them over to make sure they jive with your
	  requirements.

lists/    'whitelist' is a file that you can edit that should
	  contain sender addresses and domains that should be
	  accepted.  Is is ok if this file is empty.

	  'confirmed' is another whitelist file that contains
	  addresses of senders who have sucessfully confirmed a
	  message.  Since TMDA takes care of populating this list, 
	  you should not edit it by hand unless the mail system is
	  stopped.  Is is ok if this file remains empty.

	  'blacklist' contains sender addresses and domains that
	  should not be accepted.  Is is ok if this file is empty.
