Sample ~/.tmda/ structure to help you get started.  There is no
one-size-fits-all set of dot files, but these examples show common
usage and some of the techniques discussed in the FAQ.

You can use them as is with only a few modifications.  Copy them
with `cp -pR dot-tmda ~/.tmda' if you don't already have a ~/.tmda
directory.

Please make sure to read the documentation at http://wiki.tmda.net/
so you understand the purpose of these files and how they work.

====================================================================

config    You need to edit the ``Required settings'' section for your
          environment.

crypt_key You must generate a unique key for yourself with:
	  tmda-keygen -b >> crypt_key

filters/  Example incoming and outgoing filter files.  They
          will work as is without modification, though you should
	  look them over to make sure they jive with your
	  requirements.

lists/    'whitelist' is a file that you can edit that should
	  contain sender addresses and domains that should be
	  accepted.

	  'confirmed' is another whitelist file that contains
	  addresses of senders who have sucessfully confirmed a
	  message.  Since TMDA takes care of automatically updating
	  this list, you should not edit it by hand unless the mail
	  system is stopped.

	  'blacklist' contains sender addresses and domains that
	  should not be accepted.  Format is the same as 'whitelist'.

	  It is ok if these files are empty.
