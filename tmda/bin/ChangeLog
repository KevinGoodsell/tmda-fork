2002-01-30  Jason R. Mastaler  <jasonrm@nightshade.la.mastaler.com>

	* tmda-keygen (keygen): Use binascii.hexlify instead of
	Util.hexlify.
	
2002-01-29  Jason R. Mastaler  <jasonrm@nightshade.la.mastaler.com>

	* paths.py: Follow symlinks to find the true path.

2002-01-22  Jason R. Mastaler  <jasonrm@nightshade.la.mastaler.com>

	* tmda-inject (main): Take recipients from the Resent-* headers if
	none are given as arguments, and we are resending the message.

2002-01-19  Tim Legant  <tim@catseye.net>

	* tmda-rfilter (main): Account for change in
	FilterParser.firstmatch's return value.

	* tmda-inject (main): Ditto.

	(inject_message): Default envelope sender and Resent-From: to
	From:.  Generate multiple headers as specified in the filter file.

	(message_format): New function courtesy of Andy Bradford.

	(make_address): New function, mostly moved from inject_message.

2002-01-14  Jason R. Mastaler  <jasonrm@nightshade.la.mastaler.com>

	* tmda-filter (fp): Re-raise the exception when SystemExit is
	encountered, and catch all exceptions otherwise.

	(fp): Remove import of TMDA.Errors (no longer necessary).

2002-01-11  Jason R. Mastaler  <jasonrm@nightshade.la.mastaler.com>

	* tmda-rfilter (envelope_recipient): We no longer look for an
	X-*-Originally-To header by default.  Instead, we look for the
	header contained in RECIPIENT_HEADER if it's set by the user.

	(main): Only check for an unqualified envelope_sender and
	envelope_recipient if the MTA is Sendmail since the other MTAs
	always produce fully qualified addresses.

	(recipient_address): Only parse Defaults.VIRTUALDOMAINS if the MTA
	is qmail.  
	
2002-01-09  Jason R. Mastaler  <jasonrm@nightshade.la.mastaler.com>

	* tmda-rfilter (list_headers): Add `Mailing-List' to the list of
	headers to check for disabling auto-replies.

	(envelope_recipient): Look for X-TMDA-Originally-To instead of
	X-Originally-To.

2002-01-08  Jason R. Mastaler  <jasonrm@nightshade.la.mastaler.com>

	* tmda-keygen: Add a command-line option (-d, --device) to specify
	a different random data source device other than /dev/urandom.

2002-01-07  Jason R. Mastaler  <jasonrm@nightshade.la.mastaler.com>

	* tmda-filter: Two changes: 1) add the version of Python to the
	traceback output, and 2) write the log in UTC instead of
	localtime.

2002-01-06  Jason R. Mastaler  <jasonrm@nightshade.la.mastaler.com>

	* tmda-check-address: Change the docstring to say it only supports
	'dated' and 'sender' addresses until the keyword address checking
	gets fixed.

2002-01-05  Jason R. Mastaler  <jasonrm@nightshade.la.mastaler.com>

	* tmda-rfilter (logit): Remove the try/except, tmda-filter will
	catch the uncaught exception.
	
	(send_bounce): Ditto.

	(send_cc): Ditto.

	(inject_pending): Ditto.

	* tmda-filter: Try to look for the user's LOGFILE_DEBUG setting
	first, and if we can't log to that, fall back to
	~/TMDA_DELIVERY_FAILURE.

	In addition to StandardError derived exceptions, also catch TMDA's
	own exceptions.
	
2002-01-03  Jason R. Mastaler  <jasonrm@nightshade.la.mastaler.com>

	* tmda-rfilter (logit): Rename LOGFILE to LOGFILE_INCOMING.  Also
	make the time value optional.

	(main): Remove time.time() parameter to logit calls.

2002-01-03  Matt Armstrong  <matt@lickey.com>

	* tmda-address: now prints a newline after the address.  New
	options -n and --no-newline prevent the new behavior.

2002-01-03  Jason R. Mastaler  <jasonrm@nightshade.la.mastaler.com>

	* tmda-filter: Replace tmda-filter with a wrapper script, and
	rename it 'tmda-rfilter'.

	(execdir): Import time only right before trying to log the
	exception so that TZ set in the tmdarc is honored.
	
2002-01-02  Jason R. Mastaler  <jasonrm@nightshade.la.mastaler.com>

	* tmda-sendmail (usage): Remove the `-bs' option, since
	tmda-inject does not support it.

2002-01-01  Jason R. Mastaler  <jasonrm@nightshade.la.mastaler.com>

	* tmda-filter (address_extension): If we are running a qmail
	virtualdomain, address_extension needs to have both the "prepend"
	and virtual username stripped off to be accurate.

	(verify_confirm_cookie): Now we also check whether the message
	actually exists in the pending queue before proceeding.

	(release_pending): Renamed locate_pending since we no longer check
	whether the message exists here.

	(inject_pending): Don't unlink the confirmed message yet, we need
	it around for verify_confirm_cookie to look for later on.

2001-12-27  Jason R. Mastaler  <jasonrm@nightshade.la.mastaler.com>

	* tmda-filter (logit): Use Util.unixdate() for the Date: field.

	(inject_pending): Use Util.unixdate() for X-TMDA-Confirmed.

	* tmda-address: Rename tmda-make-address tmda-address.

2001-12-24  Jason R. Mastaler  <jasonrm@nightshade.la.mastaler.com>

	* tmda-make-address: New program that replaces tmda-dated-address,
	tmda-keyword-address, and tmda-sender-address.

2001-12-20  Jason R. Mastaler  <jasonrm@nightshade.la.mastaler.com>

	* tmda-filter: If SENDER or RECIPIENT is not in the environment,
	print a warning and raise an exception that defers delivery.

2001-12-19  Jason R. Mastaler  <jasonrm@nightshade.la.mastaler.com>

	* tmda-filter (list_headers): Turn off auto-replies if the message
	contains any List-XXX: headers.

2001-12-17  Jason R. Mastaler  <jasonrm@nightshade.la.mastaler.com>

	* tmda-filter (verify_keyword_cookie): Bugfix.  Wasn't able to
	handle `.' within a keyword.  Now after splitting the cookie on
	`.', everything after the last dot is the mac, and everything
	before it is the keyword.
	Reported by Matt Armstrong.

2001-12-14  Jason R. Mastaler  <jasonrm@nightshade.la.mastaler.com>

	* tmda-filter (envelope_sender): Fully qualify the envelope sender
	if it only contains the user part.  This will be the case when
	local mail is exchanged on a Sendmail box.

	(envelope_recipient): Ditto.

2001-12-13  Jason R. Mastaler  <jasonrm@nightshade.la.mastaler.com>

	* tmda-filter (send_bounce): Get X-Delivery-Agent info from
	Version.py instead of Defaults.py.

	* tmda-inject (inject_message): Ditto.

2001-12-12  Jason R. Mastaler  <jasonrm@nightshade.la.mastaler.com>

	* tmda-inject (inject_message): Optionally, add an
	X-TMDA-Fingerprint header.

2001-12-11  Jason R. Mastaler  <jasonrm@nightshade.la.mastaler.com>

	* tmda-inject (inject_message): Optionally remove the headers
	contained in Defaults.PURGED_HEADERS.
	
2001-12-10  Jason R. Mastaler  <jasonrm@nightshade.la.mastaler.com>

	* tmda-inject (inject_message): Bugfix.  tmda-inject was not
	tagging addresses in Mail-Followup-To headers generated by the
	MUA.  This was a problem because the header would direct followups
	to the untagged address.  Now we check whether Mail-Followup-To
	contains the untagged address, and if so, we tag that as well so
	that it matches From.  Reported by Adam McKenna.

	(inject_message): Add `Message-ID' and `Date' headers only if they
	don't already exist.

	(usage): Rearrange order of module imports so that TMDA.Defaults
	is imported before time is.  This is so the user's TZ environment
	variable setting is globally respected.
	
2001-12-07  Jason R. Mastaler  <jasonrm@nightshade.la.mastaler.com>

	* tmda-inject (inject_message): Support the `unquoted'
	MESSAGE_FROM_STYLE option.

2001-12-06  Jason R. Mastaler  <jasonrm@nightshade.la.mastaler.com>

	* tmda-filter (auto_reply): Consolidate the Precedence checking
	code.

	(locate_pending): Append the original envelope sender address
	contained in the message to CONFIRM_APPEND rather than the
	envelope sender of the subsequent confirmation reply.

2001-12-04  Jason R. Mastaler  <jasonrm@nightshade.la.mastaler.com>

	* tmda-filter (locate_pending): Optionally copy the confirmation
	reply to CONFIRM_ACCEPT_CC.
	Patch contributed by Matt Armstrong.

2001-11-30  Jason R. Mastaler  <jasonrm@nightshade.la.mastaler.com>

	* tmda-filter (usage): Rearrange order of module imports so that
	TMDA.Defaults is imported before time is.  This is so the user's
	TIMEZONE setting is globally respected.

	(send_bounce): Add our own Date header.

	(send_bounce): Add our own Message-ID header.

2001-11-29  Jason R. Mastaler  <jasonrm@nightshade.la.mastaler.com>

	* tmda-filter (envelope_sender): If the message has an empty
	envelope sender, change it to the string `<>'.  This provides a
	way of matching empty envelope senders in the filter files.

2001-11-28  Jason R. Mastaler  <jasonrm@nightshade.la.mastaler.com>

	* tmda-filter (main): Bugfix/RFC2822 compliance.  Support multiple
	e-mail addresses in the From: and Reply-To: headers.  Previously,
	tmda-filter used only the first address from each header when
	matching.
	
2001-11-26  Jason R. Mastaler  <jasonrm@nightshade.la.mastaler.com>

	* tmda-filter (main): Bugfix.  Move the check for 'confirm'
	cookies out in front of the FILTER_INCOMING.  Otherwise, the
	filter's rules might prevent the confirmation acceptance messages
	from getting through.

	(verify_confirm_cookie): Bounce rather than confirm bogus
	confirmation cookies.

2001-11-19  Jason R. Mastaler  <jasonrm@nightshade.la.mastaler.com>

	* tmda-inject (usage): Added `-M', `--filter-match' command-line
	option.  Used to match addresses against the outgoing filter file
	from the command-line for testing/debugging purposes

	* tmda-filter (usage): Added `-M', `--filter-match' command-line
	option.  Used to match addresses against the incoming filter file
	from the command-line for testing/debugging purposes.

2001-11-17  Jason R. Mastaler  <jasonrm@nightshade.la.mastaler.com>

	* tmda-inject (usage): Add `-O' to name the outgoing filter file.
	Overrides all other locations.

	* tmda-filter (usage): Add `-I' to name the incoming filter
	file.  Overrides all other locations.

2001-11-16  Jason R. Mastaler  <jasonrm@nightshade.la.mastaler.com>

	* tmda-inject: Bugfix.  "Bouncing" a message from the MUA caused
	the exiting From: header to be modified which was incorrect.  Now
	we differentiate between sending a message for the first time, and
	resending a message.  If the message has a Resent-From: header,
	it's a bounce and we tag only the envelope sender and
	Resent-From:.  Otherwise, we tag the envelope sender and From:.

	(inject_message): Give the sender action an option.  When
	sender=address, address is used to create the sender cookie rather
	than the message recipient.

2001-11-15  Jason R. Mastaler  <jasonrm@nightshade.la.mastaler.com>

	* tmda-inject (inject_message): When checking for bare=append,
	make sure cookie_option exists first before trying to string.split
	it.

2001-11-14  Jason R. Mastaler  <jasonrm@nightshade.la.mastaler.com>

	* tmda-inject (inject_message): Support Defaults.BARE_APPEND.

	* tmda-filter (main): Consult ACTION_INCOMING to decide how to
	dispose of messages by default rather than always requesting
	confirmation.
	
	* tmda-inject (main): Use ACTION_OUTGOING instead of COOKIE_TYPE
	to specify the default tagging type.

2001-11-08  Jason R. Mastaler  <jasonrm@nightshade.la.mastaler.com>

	* tmda-filter (send_cc): Replaces bounce_cc.

	(main): Parse a single filter file (Defaults.FILTER_INCOMING)
	instead of multiple list files looking for disposal instructions.
	Obsoletes BLACKLIST, WHITELIST, SACRED_FILE, and REVOKED_FILE.
	
2001-11-07  Jason R. Mastaler  <jasonrm@nightshade.la.mastaler.com>

	* tmda-inject (inject_message): Add 'as' as an aliases for 'exp'.
	(main): FilterParser.firstmatch now returns the matching line as
	well.
	
2001-11-06  Jason R. Mastaler  <jasonrm@nightshade.la.mastaler.com>

	* tmda-inject: Parse an single 'outgoing' style filter file to
	obtain the tagging information rather than combination of 'dated',
	'sender', 'bare', 'exp', 'ext', and 'keyword'.  X-TMDA now uses
	the 'action=option' syntax rather than 'action option'
	
2001-10-29  Jason R. Mastaler  <jasonrm@nightshade.la.mastaler.com>

	* tmda-inject (main): Don't downcase address_list since
	Util.findmatch now does case-insensitive comparisons.

	* tmda-filter (main): Remove downcasing of addresses here since
	Util.findmatch now does case-insensitive comparisons.

2001-10-25  Jason R. Mastaler  <jasonrm@nightshade.la.mastaler.com>

	* tmda-inject (inject_message): Support MESSAGE_FROM_STYLE.

	(main): Add support for tagging messages with keyword addresses 
	that match KEYWORD_FILE.

	(main): Fixed a bug where if the recipient list was being passed
	to tmda-inject, the recipient addresses were not being lowercased.
	This resulted in a negative match with the listfiles if their
	cases differed.  (i.e, mail sent to Jason@mastaler.com wouldn't
	match jason@mastaler.com in lists/sender).

	(main): For X-TMDA:, add `extension' as an alias for `ext', and
	`explicit' as an alias for `exp'.

2001-10-24  Jason R. Mastaler  <jasonrm@nightshade.la.mastaler.com>

	* tmda-filter (verify_confirm_cookie): Make sure the cookie
	unpacks into 4 elements (action, timestamp, pid, HMAC) or else we
	consider it bogus and request confirmation.  This fixes a bug
	where Python would raise a ValueError if you sent a message to
	`user-confirm-foo' for example.  Reported by Kirill Miazine.

	* tmda-inject (inject_message): Add support for keyword message
	tagging.

	(main): Add X-TMDA: keyword support.  Also convert the first
	section of X-TMDA to lowercase before evaluating.  Previously, a
	non-lowercase tag type (e.g, X-TMDA: SENDER) would break things.
	
2001-10-23  Jason R. Mastaler  <jasonrm@nightshade.la.mastaler.com>

	* tmda-filter (verify_keyword_cookie): New function.

	(main): If cookie_type is neither of 'confirm', 'dated', or
	'sender', we assume it's a 'keyword' cookie with a cookie_value
	that's the same as ext.

	(main): Verify the cookie if cookie_type is 'keyword'.
	
	* tmda-check-address: Add support for verifying keyword addresses.
	
	* tmda-keyword-address: New program to generate a tagged
	(keyword-style) e-mail address from the command-line.

2001-10-10  Jason R. Mastaler  <jasonrm@nightshade.la.mastaler.com>

	* tmda-filter (send_bounce): For good measure, wrap the popen2
	call in a try/except and defer upon IOError.

	(bounce_cc): Ditto.

	(logit): Add a `Sndr' line to the logfile when the message's
	envelope sender differs from the From: address.

	(logit): Only write a `From' line to the logfile if such a header
	exists.

	(logit): Only write a `Sndr' line to the logfile if such a header
	exists.

	(locate_pending): Add a LOGFILE entry before bounce.

	(verify_confirm_cookie): Clarify the LOGFILE entries before
	bounce.
		
2001-10-09  Jason R. Mastaler  <jasonrm@nightshade.la.mastaler.com>

	* tmda-sendmail (main): Bugfix.  Recipients being passed to
	tmda-sendmail as arguments weren't being propogated to
	tmda-inject.  This is now fixed unless `-t' is specified, in which
	case recipients are extracted from the message headers.

	* tmda-filter (verify_dated_cookie): Move check for --discard to
	into bouncegen().

	(verify_sender_cookie): Ditto.

	(bouncegen): Check at the top level whether --discard was
	specified, and if so, stop processing rather than bounce.

	(main): After passing through the list file and tagged message
	checks, it is no longer relevant to assign the default COOKIE_TYPE
	and then cycle back through the loop.  Instead, we just bounce the
	message for confirmation request if we reach that point.  The
	result is much cleaner code.
	
2001-10-08  Jason R. Mastaler  <jason@mastaler.com>

	* tmda-filter (main): Fix a thinko where any incoming message
	would be delivered if the COOKIE_TYPE was 'bare', and none of the
	list files were matched.  Instead, send back a confirmation
	request.
	
2001-10-08  Jason R. Mastaler  <jasonrm@nightshade.la.mastaler.com>

	* tmda-filter (inject_pending): For consistency, X-TMDA-Confirmed
	now writes date in localtime just like the LOGFILE entries.

	* tmda-sendmail (usage): Set $NAME rather than $QMAILNAME if
	invoked with `-F'.

	* tmda-inject (main): Update exit status codes from Defaults.py.
	
	(inject_message): MTA generalization.  Remove use of
	qmail-specific environment variables to tag the message.  Instead,
	set the "From:" header, and then set the envelope sender address
	with `sendmail -f user@host'.  Also removed the rather redundant
	send_* functions, and moved their functionality into
	inject_message.

	(main): Rather than setting qmail-specific environment variables,
	append to the `envelope_sender_address' and `sender_full_name'
	lists to build the sender tag.
	
	* tmda-sendmail: Remove qmail-specific bits.

2001-10-05  Jason R. Mastaler  <jasonrm@nightshade.la.mastaler.com>

	* tmda-filter: Instead of raising qmail-specific exit codes to
	control the behavior of messages, use an MTA instance to do so.

2001-10-02  Jason R. Mastaler  <jasonrm@nightshade.la.mastaler.com>

	* tmda-filter (bounce_cc): Use popen2 for uniformity.

	(inject_pending): Replace references to `-' with
	RECIPIENT_DELIMITER.

	(main): Ditto.  Also check for Postfix's EXTENSION environment
	variable which is analogous to qmail's EXT.
	
	(send_bounce): Use the more general SENDMAIL interface to send
	confirmation messages rather than INJECT.  We pass
	BOUNCE_ENV_SENDER as the argument to `sendmail -f' to set the
	envelope sender.

	(inject_pending): Use the more general SENDMAIL interface to send
	confirmation messages rather than INJECT.  We parse the
	Return-Path header from the message and pass that as the argument
	to `sendmail -f' to set the envelope sender.
	
2001-09-26  Jason R. Mastaler  <jasonrm@nightshade.la.mastaler.com>

	* tmda-filter (inject_pending): Change `X-Confirmed' header to
	`X-TMDA-Confirmed' to avoid potential clashes with other headers
	of that name.  Modify the format of the header contents
	accordingly.
	
2001-09-24  Jason R. Mastaler  <jasonrm@nightshade.la.mastaler.com>

	* tmda-filter (verify_confirm_cookie): Compactify string.split
	code.
	
2001-09-17  Jason R. Mastaler  <jasonrm@nightshade.la.mastaler.com>

	* tmda-keygen (keygen): When /dev/urandom is not available, warn
	the user that use of a cryptographic random number generator is
	preferred.

2001-09-13  Jason R. Mastaler  <jasonrm@nightshade.la.mastaler.com>

	* tmda-filter (main): Support a "revoked" list of recipient
	addresses that are to be bounced.

	* tmda-sendmail (usage): Compact the options with list expansion
	for brevity.  Thanks to Ron Bickers for the hint.

2001-09-12  Jason R. Mastaler  <jasonrm@nightshade.la.mastaler.com>

	* tmda-keygen (usage): Add a "batch" (-b) option to output only
	the CRYPT_KEY line.

	* tmda-inject (main): Add some error checking.  tmda-inject was
	failing when the message contained no "From:" header.

	* tmda-sendmail: New program.  A sendmail compatibility wrapper
	adapted from qmail's sendmail.c.

2001-09-05  Jason R. Mastaler  <jasonrm@nightshade.la.mastaler.com>

	* tmda-filter (locate_pending): Support WHITELIST_AUTO_APPEND.
	
2001-09-04  Jason R. Mastaler  <jasonrm@nightshade.la.mastaler.com>

	* tmda-filter (bouncegen): Add `original_message_headers' as an
	additional variable to be optionally used in templates.

	(bouncegen): If the message's size is greater than
	CONFIRM_MAX_MESSAGE_SIZE, exclude the message body from
	`original_message'.

2001-09-01  Jason R. Mastaler  <jasonrm@nightshade.la.mastaler.com>

	* tmda-inject (usage): Accept an `-f' option, but don't do
	anything with it.

2001-08-30  Jason R. Mastaler  <jasonrm@nightshade.la.mastaler.com>

	* tmda-filter (send_bounce): Add a "Precedence: bulk" header to
	outgoing confirmation request/acceptance messages.

2001-08-29  Jason R. Mastaler  <jasonrm@nightshade.la.mastaler.com>

	* tmda-filter (auto_reply): Don't auto-reply to a message with a
	"Precedence: list" header either.

2001-08-28  Jason R. Mastaler  <jasonrm@nightshade.la.mastaler.com>

	* tmda-filter (recipient_address): Only parse VIRTUALDOMAINS if
	support is turned on *and* the file exists.

	(auto_reply): Check for "Precedence: bulk" or "Precedence: junk"
	headers before sending a confirmation request or acceptance
	notice.

	(recipient_address): Add support for wildcards and "virtual user"
	entries in VIRTUALDOMAINS.

2001-08-27  Jason R. Mastaler  <jasonrm@nightshade.la.mastaler.com>

	* tmda-filter (original_recipient): USEVIRTUALDOMAINS replaces
	QMAILVIRTUALDOMAINS.

	(bouncegen): Renamed original_recipient to recipient_address.

2001-08-24  Jason R. Mastaler  <jasonrm@nightshade.la.mastaler.com>

	* tmda-filter (original_recipient): original_recipient is the
	original address the message was sent to, not qmail-send's
	rewritten interpretation.  This is now used in the code and
	templates instead of envelope_recipient.

2001-08-23  Jason R. Mastaler  <jasonrm@nightshade.la.mastaler.com>

	* tmda-filter (bouncegen): Add support for Debian Linux packages
	whose conffiles need to live in /etc/tmda/.

2001-08-21  Jason R. Mastaler  <jasonrm@nightshade.la.mastaler.com>

	* tmda-sender-address: Don't need the string module here.

	* tmda-dated-address: Ditto.

	* tmda-dated-address (address): Bugfix: Don't split the address
	just yet.

	* tmda-sender-address (address): Ditto.
	
	* tmda-filter (main): Allow ANY mail that has a certain regular
	expression to go through. So, let's say you wanted any mail about
	car.*accident to come through, you can do so.
	Defaults.SACRED_FILE contains the regular expressions.
	Patch contributed by Binesh Bannerjee.

2001-08-20  Jason R. Mastaler  <jasonrm@nightshade.la.mastaler.com>

	* tmda-filter (main): Silently drop messages that match the
	blacklist instead of bouncing it back to sender.

	* tmda-inject (main): If recipients are provided as command line
	arguments, tmda-inject now uses those to send the message.
	Otherwise, the header addresses are used as before.  Also, the
	from address used to create the tagged address is now taken from
	the message's From: header, if available.  Otherwise, the .tmdarc
	settings are used as before.
	Patch contributed by Ron Bickers.

	(main): Add error checking for bogus/malformed From: headers.

	(main): Don't set QMAILNAME in the environment if the From: header
	is lacking the user's full name.
	
	* tmda-dated-address: Add an option to specify the address to base
	the tagging on vs. the default USERNAME/HOSTNAME settings.
	Patch contributed by Ron Bickers.

	* tmda-sender-address: Ditto.
		
2001-08-15  Jason R. Mastaler  <jasonrm@nightshade.la.mastaler.com>

	* tmda-clean: Added months (M) and years (Y).

2001-07-26  Jason R. Mastaler  <jasonrm@nightshade.la.mastaler.com>

	* tmda-filter (main): Much cleaner cookie parsing.  
	Patch contributed by Ron Bickers.

2001-07-23  Jason R. Mastaler  <jasonrm@nightshade.la.mastaler.com>

	* tmda-filter (locate_pending): Send confirmation acceptance
	notice from bouncegen() instead of here.

	(main): Check for 'confirm' addresses before looking at the
	whitelist in case a confirmation is sent from a whitelisted
	sender.
		
	(bouncegen): Add optional 'dated' and 'sender' variables if
	specified in the .tmdarc.

2001-07-22  Jason R. Mastaler  <jasonrm@nightshade.la.mastaler.com>

	* tmda-filter: Make confirmation mode the only option.

2001-07-18  Jason R. Mastaler  <jasonrm@nightshade.la.mastaler.com>

	* tmda-filter: stat module not necessary here.

2001-07-17  Jason R. Mastaler  <jasonrm@nightshade.la.mastaler.com>

	* tmda-clean: New script to remove old messages from the pending
	queue.

	* tmda-filter (inject_pending): Change format of `X-Confirmed:' to
	resemble rfc822 dates to more easily compare it to the `Date:'
	header.

	(send_bounce): Make inclusion of the original message optional by
	defining it in the templates instead.

	(bouncegen): Save the pending message with a Return-Path: header
	so that when reinjected it will be sent with the original envelope
	sender.  This will allow any post-TMDA processing that uses the
	envelope sender to work as expected.

2001-07-13  Jason R. Mastaler  <jasonrm@nightshade.la.mastaler.com>

	* tmda-filter (verify_confirm_cookie): New function to validate a
	confirmation cookie.

2001-07-12  Jason R. Mastaler  <jasonrm@nightshade.la.mastaler.com>

	* tmda-filter (usage): Added command-line options for
	specification of the two confirmation templates.

	(bouncegen): New function that replaces both bounce_dated() and
	bounce_sender().
	
	(send_bounce): Add headers in the templates instead of here.
	
2001-07-03  Jason R. Mastaler  <jasonrm@nightshade.la.mastaler.com>

	* tmda-check-address: New program to check the validity of tagged
	addresses.  Contributed by Ron Bickers.

	(usage): Add an optional flag to display dates in the local time
	zone instead of UTC.

2001-06-25  Jason R. Mastaler  <jasonrm@nightshade.la.mastaler.com>

	* tmda-filter (envelope_recipient): Use the `X-Originally-To'
	header for the envelope_recipient value if it exists.  
	Patch contributed by Ron Bickers.

	(main): No need to lookup $SENDER a second time.

2001-06-13  Jason R. Mastaler  <jasonrm@nightshade.la.mastaler.com>

	* tmda-filter (main): Lowercase the env sender, From and Reply-to
	before sending them into Util.findmatch because fnmatch does
	case-sensitive comparison on Unix.

2001-06-12  Jason R. Mastaler  <jasonrm@nightshade.la.mastaler.com>

	* tmda-filter (main): Use Util.findmatch instead of
	Util.substring_match.
	
2001-06-08  Jason R. Mastaler  <jasonrm@nightshade.la.mastaler.com>

	* tmda-filter (verify_dated_cookie): Check for the discard
	variable before calling bounce_dated() in all 3 cases.

2001-06-06  Jason R. Mastaler  <jasonrm@nightshade.la.mastaler.com>

	* tmda-filter (bounce_dated): If the template doesn't exist in
	../templates/, we assume installation from an RPM, so look in
	sys.prefix/share/tmda/.

	(bounce_sender): Ditto.
	
2001-06-04  Jason R. Mastaler  <jasonrm@nightshade.la.mastaler.com>

	* tmda-filter (envelope_sender): The envelope sender is used in
	more than one place.

	(send_bounce): Use the popen2 module instead of os.popen to inject
	the message.  This works around an undetermined bug in some BSD
	variants where python hangs after message delivery.

	(bounce_dated): Add the ability to draw the bounce template from
	multiple locations.  Command line takes priority, followed by the
	.tmdarc setting, followed by the default in ../templates/.

	(bounce_sender): Ditto.

	(bounce_dated): Exit ERR_STOP (99) so qmail no longer sends its
	own bounce, but .qmail processing still stops.

	(bounce_sender): Ditto.

	(send_bounce): New function that creates and sends a bounce
	message back to the envelope sender with an 'X-Delivery-Agent'
	header added for easier identification.
	
2001-06-01  Jason R. Mastaler  <jasonrm@nightshade.la.mastaler.com>

	* tmda-inject (main): Fix to make 'QMAILRCPTS' addresses match
	case insensitively.

	* tmda-dated-address (main): Bugfix. When you provide extra
	arguments to tmda-sender-address (e.g. -c /other/.tmdarc), the
	wrong argument is read.

	* tmda-sender-address (main): Ditto.

2001-05-29  Jason R. Mastaler  <jasonrm@nightshade.la.mastaler.com>

	* tmda-keygen (key): Add some integrity checking to make sure
	generated key is the correct length.

	* tmda-filter (main): Add the '-d' option to silently discard the
	message and stop processing of the .qmail file (ERR_STOP) instead
	of bouncing the message back to sender.
	
	* tmda-inject (main): When using TMDA with qfilter, Bcc recipients
	are silently ignored since they aren't in the headers at the time
	qfilter passes the message to tmda-inject.  Fix this by making
	tmda-inject use the QMAILRCPTS environment variable set by qfilter
	when it's available, instead of getting the address list from the
	headers.  This variable will contain a list of envelope
	recipients, which will include any Bcc recipients.

2001-05-28  Jason R. Mastaler  <jason@mastaler.com>

	* tmda-sender-address (main): Bugfix.  When you provide arguments
	to tmda-sender-address (e.g. -c /other/.tmdarc), the address is
	incorrectly read as sys.argv[1] (which would be '-c') and thus
	returns an invalid address.

2001-05-24  Jason R. Mastaler  <jasonrm@nightshade.la.mastaler.com>

	* tmda-inject (qfilter): tmda-inject will exit 99 when run with
	the -q argument so that qmail-qfilter will not run qmail-queue.
	Necessary when running TMDA through a qmail relay.

2001-05-23  Jason R. Mastaler  <jasonrm@nightshade.la.mastaler.com>

	* tmda-filter (main): Add support for "pre-extension" definitions
	in /var/qmail/users/assign.
	
	* tmda-inject (main): Special case files can now contain
	substrings instead of only explicit addresses to match.  To
	support this, exp and ext cases are now stored in lists like the
	other cases instead of dictionaries.  Processing is done with
	Util.findmatch.

2001-05-21  Jason R. Mastaler  <jasonrm@nightshade.la.mastaler.com>

	* tmda-dated-address (main): Support an optional timeout argument
	to override Defaults.TIMEOUT.

2001-05-17  Jason R. Mastaler  <jasonrm@nightshade.la.mastaler.com>

	* tmda-filter (main): Fixed virtualdomain detection to work under
	all cases.

2001-05-13  Jason R. Mastaler  <jasonrm@nightshade.la.mastaler.com>

	* tmda-inject (main): Support `X-TMDA: dated timeout'
	(to override Defaults.TIMEOUT)

2001-05-10  Jason R. Mastaler  <jasonrm@nightshade.la.mastaler.com>

	* tmda-inject (inject_message): Use the popen2 module instead of
	os.popen to work around an undetermined bug in some BSD variants
	where the mutt MUA hangs when sending with tmda-inject.

	(main): Add the platform identifier to X-Delivery-Agent for easier
	diagnosis of platform dependent problems.

2001-05-02  Jason R. Mastaler  <jasonrm@nightshade.acl.lanl.gov>

	* tmda-filter (make_dated_bounce): Depreciated function.
	(make_sender_bounce): Ditto.
	(bounce_dated): Read the bounce message text from a template file
	in ../templates/dated_bounce.txt to ease local customization.
	(bounce_sender): Ditto (bounce_sender.txt).

2001-04-29  Jason R. Mastaler  <jasonrm@nightshade.la.mastaler.com>

	* tmda-filter (program): Add support for alternate rcfile.

	* tmda-inject (program): Ditto.

	* tmda-dated-address: Ditto.

	* tmda-sender-address: Ditto 

	* tmda-filter (main): Add support for qmail virtualdomains as
	described in qmail-send(8).

2001-04-28  Jason R. Mastaler  <jasonrm@nightshade.la.mastaler.com>

	* tmda-inject (main): Changed X-Delivery-Agent to include the
	Python version instead of the TMDA URL.

2001-04-27  Jason R. Mastaler  <jasonrm@nightshade.la.mastaler.com>

	* tmda-keygen (keygen): Replace /dev/random with /dev/urandom;
	/dev/urandom is secure enough for almost any application and saves
	you from blocking.

2001-04-26  Jason R. Mastaler  <jasonrm@nightshade.la.mastaler.com>

	* tmda-filter (verify_dated_cookie): Modified to accommodate the
	new HMAC cookies.

	* tmda-keygen: Remove amkCrypto references.
	(keygen): Collect pseudo-random data from the command-line for key
	material if /dev/random is not available.

2001-04-25  Jason R. Mastaler  <jasonrm@nightshade.la.mastaler.com>

	* tmda-filter : added "mailto:" to the tagged address in the
	bounce message to make it easier to reply to.  Thanks to Paul
	English for the suggestion.

	(bounce_cc): New function to send a copy of a bounced message for
	each of 'blacklist', 'dated', and 'sender'.

	(main): tmda-filter now consults the "whitelist" no matter what
	the destination address is.

2001-04-24  Jason R. Mastaler  <jasonrm@nightshade.la.mastaler.com>

	* tmda-filter (main): changed all references of Whitelist.match()
	to Greylist.match().
