TMDA is an open source software application designed to significantly
reduce the amount of spam (Internet junk-mail) you receive.  TMDA
strives to be more effective, yet less time-consuming than traditional
spam filters.  TMDA can also be used as a general purpose local mail
delivery agent to filter, sort, deliver and dispose of incoming mail.
                                                   
The technical countermeasures used by TMDA to thwart spam include:

* whitelists: accept mail from known, trusted senders.

* blacklists: refuse mail from undesired senders.

* challenge/response: allows unknown senders which aren't on the
  whitelist or blacklist the chance to confirm that their message is
  legitimate (non-spam).

* tagged addresses: special-purpose e-mail addresses such as
  time-dependent addresses, or addresses which only accept certain
  kinds of communication.  These increase the transparency of TMDA for
  unknown senders by allowing them to safely circumvent the
  challenge/response system.
