Acknowledgements:
-----------------

    * Thomas Erskine -- the author of TMS (the predecessor of TMDA).

    * Guido van Rossum -- for creating Python, my language of choice.
    Python allowed me to develop a working version of this software in
    just a couple of weeks.  This could have easily been a multi-month
    project in C/C++, or a shorter project in Perl, with working but
    ugly and unmaintainable results.
    
    * Andrew Archibald -- provided lots of cryptography-related help and
    insight.  Much of the crypto design in TMDA stems from his input.

Contributions:
--------------

    * Ron Bickers -- for contributing the `README.RELAY' HOWTO,
    as well as many suggestions, bugfixes and patches.

    * Reuben Sumner -- for contributing the HMAC.py module and for
    suggesting the "blacklist" functionality.

    * Ted Rathkopf -- for contributing support for "pre-extension"
    definitions in /var/qmail/users/assign.
