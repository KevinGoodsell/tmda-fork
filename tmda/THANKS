Developers:
-----------

    TMDA was originally developed by Jason R. Mastaler.  Subsequent
    development towards the 1.0 final release was a group effort; the
    core contributors being Jason R. Mastaler and Tim Legant, with
    contributions from many others.

Acknowledgements:
-----------------

    * Thomas Erskine -- the author of TMS, from which TMDA derived the
      concept of tagged addresses.  TMS served as the impetus for
      developing TMDA.

    * Guido van Rossum -- for creating Python, my language of choice.
      Python allowed me to develop a working version of this software
      in just a couple of weeks.  This could have easily been a
      multi-month project in C/C++, or a shorter project in Perl, with
      working but ugly and unmaintainable results.
    
    * Andrew Archibald -- provided lots of cryptography-related help and
      insight.  Much of the crypto design in TMDA stems from his input.

Notable contributions:
------------------

    * Matt Armstrong -- contributed heavily to the Postfix support,
      plus many good suggestions, and bugfixes.

    * Charles Cazabon -- Maildir and mbox delivery code from getmail.

    * Chris Hardie -- designed and donated the TMDA logo.

    * Gre7g Luterman -- tmda-cgi, a popular web interface to TMDA's
      pending queue.

    * Michael Schler -- registration of, and secondary nameservice for
      the tmda.net domain.

    * Reuben Sumner -- original HMAC module.

    * David Guerizec and Jim Ramsay -- secondary developers.

    * The maintainers of TMDA's packages for various flavors of Linux
      and *BSD.

    * The countless invaluable suggestions, bugfixes, and improvements
      by the members of the tmda-users and tmda-workers mailing lists.
