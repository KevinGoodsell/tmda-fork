Acknowledgements:
-----------------

    * Thomas Erskine -- the author of TMS (the predecessor of TMDA).

    * Guido van Rossum -- for creating Python, my language of choice.
      Python allowed me to develop a working version of this software
      in just a couple of weeks.  This could have easily been a
      multi-month project in C/C++, or a shorter project in Perl, with
      working but ugly and unmaintainable results.
    
    * Andrew Archibald -- provided lots of cryptography-related help and
      insight.  Much of the crypto design in TMDA stems from his input.
