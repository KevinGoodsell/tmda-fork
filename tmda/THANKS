Acknowledgements:
-----------------

    * Thomas Erskine -- the author of TMS (the predecessor of TMDA).

    * Guido van Rossum -- for creating Python, my language of choice.
      Python allowed me to develop a working version of this software
      in just a couple of weeks.  This could have easily been a
      multi-month project in C/C++, or a shorter project in Perl, with
      working but ugly and unmaintainable results.
    
    * Andrew Archibald -- provided lots of cryptography-related help and
      insight.  Much of the crypto design in TMDA stems from his input.

Contributions:
--------------

    * Matt Armstrong -- contributed heavily to the Postfix support,
      plus many good suggestions, and bugfixes.

    * Binesh Bannerjee -- SACRED_FILE feature (now deprecated).
    
    * Ron Bickers -- countless suggestions, bugfixes, documentation
      additions, and code patches (too many to list).

    * Francisco Sam Castillo -- QAdmin-TMDA web management utility.

    * Charles Cazabon -- Maildir and mbox delivery code from getmail.

    * Vincent Danen -- Mandrake Linux RPMs.

    * Bill Duncan -- SquirrelMail plugin.

    * Jonathan Ellis -- substantial patch to clean up the address
      matching code in FilterParser.py.  Much of the code was re-
      factored into a new FilterStore.py module as classes.

    * Michael S. Fischer -- tmda-pending patch which allows messages
      to be specified on standard input.

    * Arcady Genkin -- Gentoo Linux Package.

    * Jim Geovedi -- OpenBSD port (formerly by David Lebel).

    * Jesse Guardiani -- vipmap-to-authmap script.

    * David Guerizec -- Pending.py module, lots of tmda-ofmipd
      improvements, miscellaneous bugfixes, and tmda-gui (TKinter
      interface).

    * Chris Hardie -- mirror of www.tmda.net.

    * Lou Hevly -- documentation (vpopmail tutorial).

    * Mark Horn -- Configurable actions for tagged address
      verification failures.

    * Josh Huber -- tmda.el.

    * Brian Lalor -- testing the initial Sendmail support; bugfixes.

    * Tim "FilterParser" Legant -- By far the most prolific
      contributor, whose work includes:

      - Rewrite of FilterParser.py plus many improvements to the
        filter file language such as support for multi-line,
        multi-action filters, support for arguments, new delivery
        actions, improved error reporting, macros, variable
        interpolation, sub-filters, and assorted new arguments such as
        `-autocdb', `-autodbm', and `-optional'.

      - The def2html script. 

      - The Address.py module. 

      - VPopMail/VMailMgr support and HOWTO.

      - Documentation, general bugfixes, design assistance,
        suggestions and tmda-users support.

    * Gre7g Luterman -- tmda-cgi, a web interface to TMDA's pending
      queue.

    * Adam McKenna -- Debian package.

    * Mike Meyer -- FreeBSD port.

    * Drew Raines -- Tireless assistance on tmda-users; custom address
      type identifiers feature.

    * Ted Rathkopf -- support for "pre-extension" definitions in
      /var/qmail/users/assign (now deprecated).

    * Amitai Schlair -- NetBSD package.

    * Michael Schler -- registration of, and secondary nameservice for
      TMDA.NET.

      de.* newsgroups, and documentation (Gnus HOWTO).
