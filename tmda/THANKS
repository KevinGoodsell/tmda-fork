    * Thomas Erskine -- the author of TMS, the predecessor of TMDA.

    * Guido van Rossum -- for creating Python, my language of choice.
    Python allowed me to develop a working version of this software in
    just a couple of weeks.  This could have easily been a multi-month
    project in C/C++, or a shorter project in Perl, with working but
    ugly and unmaintainable results.
    
    * Andrew Archibald -- provided much cryptography-related help and
    insight. Most of the crypto design in TMDA stems from his input.
