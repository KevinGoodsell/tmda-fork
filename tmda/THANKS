Acknowledgements:
-----------------

    * Thomas Erskine -- the author of TMS (the predecessor of TMDA).

    * Guido van Rossum -- for creating Python, my language of choice.
      Python allowed me to develop a working version of this software
      in just a couple of weeks.  This could have easily been a
      multi-month project in C/C++, or a shorter project in Perl, with
      working but ugly and unmaintainable results.
    
    * Andrew Archibald -- provided lots of cryptography-related help and
      insight.  Much of the crypto design in TMDA stems from his input.

Contributions:
--------------

    * Matt Armstrong -- contributed heavily to the Postfix support,
      plus many good suggestions, and bugfixes.

    * Binesh Bannerjee -- SACRED_FILE feature (now depreciated).
    
    * Ron Bickers -- countless suggestions, bugfixes, documentation
      additions, and code patches (too many to list).
     
    * Francisco Sam Castillo -- QAdmin-TMDA web management utility.

    * Lou Hevly -- documentation (vpopmail tutorial).

    * Brian Lalor -- testing the initial Sendmail support; bugfixes.

    * Tim Legant -- support for multi-line, multi-action filter files,
      and from/to-autocdb.

    * Adam McKenna -- creator/maintainer of the Debian package.

    * Ted Rathkopf -- support for "pre-extension" definitions in
      /var/qmail/users/assign (now depreciated).

    * Reuben Sumner -- the HMAC.py module.
