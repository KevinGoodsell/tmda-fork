Starting with version 0.10, TMDA's crypto-cookie generation and
verification scheme switched to using HMACs instead of block cipher
encryption, which invalidated all previous tagged addresses.  For the
motivations behind this, see `CRYPTO'.

If you are upgrading from a release of TMDA < 0.10:

* The amkCrypto package is no longer necessary as HMAC uses Python's
  built-in `sha' module for hashing.

* You need to generate a new CRYPT_KEY by running bin/tmda-keygen and
  replace your current key in ~/.tmdarc.

* You can remove BLOCK_CIPHER, CRYPT_IV, and HASH_FUNCTION from your
  ~/.tmdarc as they are no longer used.

* Again, the new 'dated' and 'sender' addresses are not compatible
  with those generated prior to v0.10, so re-issue addresses as
  necessary with bin/tmda-dated-address and bin/tmda-sender-address.
